            Unfortunately, after much consideration, we have made the difficult decision to close our doors. This was not an easy choice, as our community has been at the heart of our mission. However, circumstances have led us to this point, and we must now say goodbye.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to sincerely thank each and every one of you for being part of the MomentMC family. Your passion, creativity, and dedication have inspired us every step of the way.
