        <p>7. Intentionally lagging the server: Intentionally causing server lag can negatively impact the gameplay experience of others and server performance</p>
        <p>8. No IRL trading/ IRL scamming: Real life trading (selling in-game items for real money) is not allowed (Ex. Trading a sword in game for irl money). Agreeing to purchase server store items for in-game currency or items, but then failing to fulfill the agreement, is explicitly forbidden. Likewise, proposing to trade in-game money or items for server store items and then failing to deliver the agreed-upon in-game currency or items after obtaining the store item is also forbidden.</p>
        <p>9. Doxxing: Sharing or threatening to share personal information (doxxing) is strictly prohibited.</p>
        <p>10. Common Sense: Just because something is not explicitly stated above does not make it ok. You may be punished by a staff member for any actions you take that they feel is inappropriate and is not needed in the server.</p>
